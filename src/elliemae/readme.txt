Overview:
The class DirectoryTraverser
	public void addTask(File dir) is where tasks are added.
	
- The main class is in DirectoryTraverser.
- A jar is provided and there is also a repo on github for the src.
- There are no dependencies to build the project.  Its all implemented in Java 8.


Usage:
The config.properties is needed to set the directory paths to be read.  Tasks are added
by taking the path for dirs A,B,C and creating a file.  Paths are also needed for where to write
the report files.

The src files can be put into any IDE as there no external dependencies.  Only java8 is needed.
